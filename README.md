# SentinelSIEM

A proof-of-concept Security Information & Event Management platform built in Go, backed by Elasticsearch. Designed as the central detection and investigation brain for the Sentinel security portfolio.

![Overview Dashboard](web/docs/screenshots/02-overview.png)

## Why SentinelSIEM?

Most SIEM platforms are either expensive commercial products with opaque internals, or open-source projects that require stitching together a dozen loosely coupled tools. SentinelSIEM takes a different approach:

- **Single-binary simplicity.** Each component is a standalone Go binary — no JVM, no Python runtime, no container orchestration required. Build it, copy it, run it.
- **Native Sigma support.** Detection rules use [Sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma), the open standard used by thousands of detection engineers worldwide. Ship with 3000+ community rules on day one. No proprietary rule language to learn.
- **ECS-first normalization.** Every event from every source is normalized to the [Elastic Common Schema](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html) before it hits storage. Cross-source correlation works because the data model is consistent, not because you wrote custom joins.
- **Cross-portfolio correlation.** SentinelSIEM natively correlates across EDR, AV, DLP, Windows, and syslog sources. A malware detection on one host plus a DLP policy violation on the same user within 15 minutes? That's one alert, not two tickets in two consoles.
- **Built-in case management.** Alert escalation, observable tracking, analyst collaboration, and resolution metrics without an external tool like TheHive or ServiceNow.
- **Transparent and hackable.** The entire codebase is readable Go with minimal dependencies. If you want to add a parser, write a struct that implements one interface. If you want to add a detection, write a YAML file.

SentinelSIEM is designed for security teams that want to understand their tooling, not just operate it.

## What It Does

SentinelSIEM ingests telemetry from multiple security sources, normalizes events to ECS, evaluates Sigma detection rules in real time, and provides a query interface for threat hunting — all through a React-based dashboard with built-in case management.

### Data Sources

| Source | Protocol | Status | Description |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Sentinel EDR | JSON/HTTP | Implemented | Endpoint behavior telemetry (process, network, registry, file events) |
| Sentinel AV | JSON/HTTP | Implemented | Malware scan results, quarantine actions, real-time blocks |
| Sentinel DLP | JSON/HTTP | Implemented | Data classification, policy violations, removable media events |
| Sentinel NDR | JSON/HTTP | Implemented | Network detection & response (session, DNS, HTTP, TLS, SMB, Kerberos, etc.) |
| Windows Event Logs | WEF/HTTP | Implemented | Security, Sysmon, and system events via XML or Winlogbeat JSON |
| Syslog | TCP/UDP/TLS | Implemented | Firewalls, Linux auditd, network devices (RFC 5424 & 3164) |

### Ingestion Pipeline

- **HTTP endpoint** (`/api/v1/ingest`) — NDJSON and JSON array batch support, API key authentication, per-IP rate limiting
- **WEF endpoint** (`/api/v1/ingest/wef`) — Windows Event Forwarding with auto-detection of XML vs JSON payloads, BOM handling, batch XML splitting
- **Syslog listener** — TCP (newline-delimited + octet-counting framing), UDP, and TLS on configurable ports with connection limits and idle timeouts
- **Normalization engine** — Per-source-type parsers registered at startup, routing by `source_type` field. Extensible via the `normalize.Parser` interface
- **Syslog sub-parsers** — YAML-driven regex configs for structured field extraction (ships with iptables, auditd, generic KV). Regexes pre-compiled at startup using Go's RE2 engine (linear-time, no ReDoS)

### Detection Engine

- **Sigma rules** — Native parsing and evaluation of the open-standard YAML detection format
- **Single-event rules** — Field matching with full modifier support (`contains`, `re`, `cidr`, `base64`, `all`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, etc.)
- **Correlation rules** — Multi-event patterns: `event_count` (threshold), `value_count` (distinct values), `temporal` (ordered sequences within time windows)
- **Cross-portfolio detections** — Rules that correlate across EDR + AV + DLP sources to detect multi-stage attack chains
- **Hot-reload** — File watcher + CLI trigger for zero-downtime rule updates

### Alert Triage

Severity-coded alert queue with MITRE ATT&CK tactic tagging, source/destination IP context, status workflow (New → Acknowledged → In Progress → Escalated → Closed), and bulk actions for efficient triage.

### Case Management

Built-in incident response workflow: alert escalation, observable extraction (IPs, hashes, domains, usernames), analyst collaboration via timeline, MITRE ATT&CK tagging, and resolution tracking with detection efficacy metrics (MTTD/MTTR).

### Global Search

Universal entity search with auto-detection: type an IP, hash, domain, username, or free text and the search bar identifies the entity type, queries across all indices (events, alerts, cases, host scores, Sigma rules) in parallel, and returns grouped results. Command palette mode (`/` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) provides quick navigation and actions. Recent searches persist per user.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+
- Docker & Docker Compose (for Elasticsearch)
- Node.js 18+ (for dashboard development)
- Make

### Quick Start

```bash
make demo                     # Build, start services, create demo users, replay fixture data
```

This runs the full setup: builds binaries, starts Elasticsearch via Docker, creates an admin account and 5 demo analyst accounts via first-run setup, replays all fixture datasets, and prints access URLs and credentials.

When finished:

```bash
make demo-clean               # Disable demo users, delete all indices, stop services
```

### Build

```bash
make build       # Compiles all binaries to bin/
make test        # Runs tests
make lint        # Runs go vet
make clean       # Removes bin/ directory
```

### Run

```bash
docker compose up -d                            # Start Elasticsearch + Kibana
.\bin\sentinel-ingest.exe --config sentinel.toml  # Start ingestion server
.\bin\sentinel-query.exe --config sentinel.toml   # Start query API (separate terminal)
```

### Dashboard Development

```bash
cd web
npm install                   # Install frontend dependencies
npm run dev                   # Start Vite dev server (port 3000)
```

Requires `sentinel-query` to be running on port 8081 (Vite proxies API requests).

### Scripts

| Script | Make Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `scripts/install.sh` | `make install` | Build binaries, start Docker, apply ES templates, create admin user, print credentials |
| `scripts/demo.sh` | `make demo` | Full demo: install + 6 analyst accounts + replay all fixtures + verify |
| `scripts/demo-clean.sh` | `make demo-clean` | Teardown: disable demo users, delete all indices, stop services |
| `scripts/dev.sh` | `make dev` | Hot-reload development mode with ingest + query + Vite |
| `scripts/gen-certs.sh` | — | Generate self-signed TLS certs for syslog development |
| `scripts/wait-for-es.sh` | — | Block until Elasticsearch is healthy (used by install.sh) |

### Integration Tests

SentinelSIEM includes a comprehensive integration test suite that validates the full detection pipeline end-to-end — no Elasticsearch or running servers required.

```bash
# Run all integration tests
go test ./tests/integration/ -v

# Run just the 850-event replay test
go test ./tests/integration/ -run TestReplay850Events -v

# Run the full test suite (unit + integration)
go test ./... -v
```

**Test suite breakdown:**

| Test | What it validates |
|------|-------------------|
| `TestReplay850Events` | 850 synthetic ECS events (40 malicious + 810 benign) evaluated against 50 Sigma rules. Asserts exactly 40 alerts and zero false positives across all 6 source types. |
| `TestEngineStats` | Verifies all project rules load, compile, and map to logsource buckets. Currently: 74 compiled rules, 16 logsource buckets, 0 compile errors. |
| `TestEachRuleCategory` | Fires at least one rule per logsource category (process_creation, sentinel_av, sentinel_dlp, sentinel_ndr, windows_security, syslog_linux). |
| `TestBenignEventsZeroAlerts` | Dedicated false-positive regression test — 810 benign events must produce 0 alerts. |

The 40 malicious events cover the full attack surface:

- **15 process creation** — Mimikatz, PsExec, encoded PowerShell, certutil, WMIC, rundll32, mshta, whoami, net.exe, BITSAdmin, schtasks, download cradles, regsvr32, reg hive dump, Office child process
- **4 antivirus** — Trojan, webshell, Cobalt Strike beacon, hacktool/PUA
- **5 data loss prevention** — PCI exfil, PII violation, source code upload, USB restricted data, financial data leak
- **6 network detection** — C2 long session, large outbound transfer, Tor connection, suspicious port, DNS suspicious TLD, high packet beaconing
- **6 Windows events** — Brute force, account creation, privilege escalation, log cleared, service installed, RDP logon
- **4 Linux/syslog** — SSH brute force, sudo escalation, crontab modification, unauthorized root login

### Load Test & Benchmarks

```bash
# 30-second sustained load test (1000 events/sec, no ES required)
go test ./tests/benchmark/ -v -run TestLoadTest -loadduration=30s -timeout 2m

# Full 10-minute load test
go test ./tests/benchmark/ -v -run TestLoadTest -loadduration=10m -timeout 15m

# Per-batch and per-rule-eval benchmarks
go test ./tests/benchmark/ -bench=. -benchmem
```

Assertions: ≥90% target EPS, p95 latency <5s, rule eval p95 <10ms, heap <500MB, no event loss.

### E2E Tests

```bash
cd web
npx playwright install        # Install browser binaries (first time)
npx playwright test           # Run all E2E tests (headless)
npx playwright test --headed  # Run with visible browser
```

Requires the backend (`make run-query`) and Elasticsearch to be running. Tests cover auth flows, page rendering, navigation, theme persistence, and interactive features across 8 test suites (35 tests).

#### Documentation Screenshots

Capture full-page screenshots of every dashboard view at 1440x900 for documentation:

```bash
cd web
npm run screenshots            # Headless capture to web/docs/screenshots/
npm run screenshots:headed     # Watch it run in a visible browser
```

### Management CLI

Global flags must come **before** the subcommand (Go `flag` package requirement):

```bash
# System diagnostics (config, servers, ES, rules)
sentinel-cli diagnose

# User management
sentinel-cli --server http://localhost:8081 --api-key <key> users list
sentinel-cli --server http://localhost:8081 --api-key <key> users create --username jsmith --display-name "John Smith" --role analyst --password <pw>
sentinel-cli --server http://localhost:8081 --api-key <key> users disable --username jsmith

# API key management
sentinel-cli --server http://localhost:8081 --api-key <key> keys list
sentinel-cli --server http://localhost:8081 --api-key <key> keys create --name "ingest-prod" --scopes "ingest"

# Rules operations
sentinel-cli rules validate                                                        # Local validation only
sentinel-cli --ingest-server http://localhost:8080 --ingest-key <key> rules update   # Validate + hot-reload
sentinel-cli --ingest-server http://localhost:8080 --ingest-key <key> rules update --init  # Clone SigmaHQ + validate + reload

# Ingest testing
sentinel-cli --ingest-server http://localhost:8080 --ingest-key <key> ingest test               # Send single test event
sentinel-cli --ingest-server http://localhost:8080 --ingest-key <key> ingest replay data.ndjson  # Replay NDJSON file

# Ad-hoc queries
sentinel-cli --server http://localhost:8081 --api-key <key> query "source_type:sentinel_edr AND event.action:process_create"
sentinel-cli --server http://localhost:8081 --api-key <key> alerts --level critical
```

Global flags: `--server` (query API, default `localhost:8081`), `--ingest-server` (ingest API, default `localhost:8080`), `--api-key`, `--ingest-key`, `--json` (raw JSON output). All support environment variables (`SENTINEL_URL`, `SENTINEL_API_KEY`, `SENTINEL_INGEST_URL`, `SENTINEL_INGEST_KEY`).

### Configuration

On first run, `make install` or `make demo` generates `sentinel.toml` from `sentinel.toml.template` with random secrets. To customize, edit `sentinel.toml` directly or set environment variables before running.

### Syslog TLS Setup

```bash
./scripts/gen-certs.sh        # Generate self-signed certs for development
# Then set tls_port, tls_cert, tls_key in sentinel.toml
```

## Test Data Infrastructure

SentinelSIEM ships with comprehensive test data for development, testing, and portfolio demos.

### Static Fixtures (`tests/fixtures/`)

~580 pre-built NDJSON events covering all 6 source types and every event subtype:

| Directory | Events | Coverage |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| `sentinel_edr/` | 80 | All 13 source types (DriverProcess, DriverNetwork, DriverRegistry, etc.) |
| `sentinel_av/` | 46 | All 5 event types (scan_result, quarantine, realtime_block, etc.) |
| `sentinel_dlp/` | 47 | All 5 event types (policy_violation, classification, block, etc.) |
| `sentinel_ndr/` | 211 | All 15 protocol types (session, dns, http, tls, smb, kerberos, etc.) |
| `winevt_xml/` | 65 | Event IDs 4624/4625/4688/4768/4769/7045, Sysmon 1/3/11 |
| `winevt_json/` | 44 | Same Event IDs in Winlogbeat JSON format |
| `syslog/` | 69 | iptables, auditd, sshd, sudo, httpd, generic |
| `edge_cases/` | 28 | Missing fields, malformed JSON, unicode paths, oversized payloads, duplicate IDs |

### Scenario Generator (`tools/generate_scenarios.py`)

A Python CLI that produces realistic multi-source attack scenarios mixed with background noise, outputting replayable NDJSON files.

```bash
pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
python tools/generate_scenarios.py --scenario credential_theft --output demo.ndjson --seed 42
```

**Ships with 3 attack scenarios:**
- `credential_theft` — Recon, mimikatz credential dump, LSASS access, lateral movement, confidential file access
- `lateral_movement` — RDP to web server, PsExec to database server, service installation, data staging
- `malware_delivery` — Browser download, dropper execution, registry persistence, C2 beacon, DLP violation

Each scenario produces events across multiple source types (EDR, AV, DLP, NDR, Windows Events, syslog) with configurable noise ratio (~95% background noise by default). Entity relationships (hosts, users, IPs) are consistent across sources.

**Configuration files:**
- `tools/entities/` — Host inventory, user directory, network topology
- `tools/profiles/` — Noise profiles per host role (workstation, server, DC, firewall, NDR sensor)
- `tools/scenarios/` — YAML attack narratives with timeline definitions
